<p class="text-muted">The church and the community as a unit, used to be a source of values, of commitment, of stability and strength for children. Each of these institutions plays an important role in education and upbringing. Teachers might be used to help develop relevant job skills and supply basic literacy for those needing it, if funds and talent are available. Religion is separated from school system because it represents a strong ideology held by one group of people (Viteritti, 2007). When a single religious tradition like Christianity is numerically dominant, support for a public religion can quite easily yield preferential treatment for the majority religion. A single religious tradition can so dominate as to threaten the dissenting beliefs of other religions and of the nonreligious.</p>

<p class="text-muted">A school library is a structure within the school that houses a collection of books, audio-visual material and other content that serves common use to meet the educational, informative and recreational needs of the users. The chief objective of libraries is to meet the academic needs of the particular educational institution which it serves. Besides serving students in their studies and teachers in their research school, libraries aim at creating interest in reading amongst the students who get the best of resources and environment here.

<p> Something unexpected happened in our life, Actually It was like a surprise for us, we are completely shocked when we got to know that we won the first prize in my Inter School debate on environmental pollution. It was the second time when our team participated in debate competition. At the time when we participated for the very first time so we didn’t secure any position in this competition, At that time we felt a little sad but we decided that we will do more hard work and we will participate again and we guess that we took the right decision to participate again, Also we learned that hard work always pays off because At our first participation, we are not concerned towards this competition but when We faced failure then It inspired us to do more hard work and because of that we have got this prize, Our parents are very proud of us and they have gifted us many things like some got cycle some got new watch for our achievement and now We have known that hard work is most important to achieve success.</p>

<p>A great aspect of elementary school science projects is the lower use and involvement of various materials and the ability to arrive at the result almost immediately or in a quicker time duration in comparison to higher grades’ science experiments. Such types of science projects are great for school children because it allows us to learn, enjoy a great deal of fun and upon achieving the result, feel immensely accomplished of our performance.</p>

<h4>New School Canteen</h4>

<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Every school has a canteen and it makes it easy for students to get food from these canteens.

  On a busy day when mothers do not get time to pack lunchboxes or snack boxes, these canteens are really handy and a lifesaver.Our school also has a canteen. The canteen is very big and could accommodate many students at a time. We have a coupon system, where the students who would like to have food from the canteen, would require buying coupon for the desired item from the counter during the first short recess of the day in school.

  Then, during the lunch hour, the students assemble in the canteen and they provide their coupons. Based on the coupons, the students would be given the food that they have placed their orders for. The students needs to sit in the canteen and have the food and return back the plates. The canteen at our school would almost be full on all days. Many students come there to have their food.</p>

<h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>

<img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1.Accuracy
  Manually checking whether a student is present or not may not be so accurate and there might be a chance of mistakenly marking a student absent even when they are present. However, the student attendance management system is so precise in keeping the attendance, and students cannot perform any proxy to take attendance.
  At the same time, the system also notes down the exact login time of every student, and thereby teachers can identify the latecomers. Teachers can track the attendance and calculate the average so accurately using this automated system.

2.Economics
Economics is a social science with stakes in many other fields, including political science, geography, mathematics, sociology, psychology, engineering, law, medicine and business. The central quest of economics is to determine the most logical and effective use of resources to meet private and social goals. Production and employment, investment and savings, health, money and the banking system, government policies on taxation and spending, international trade, industrial organization and regulation, urbanization, environmental issues and legal matters (such as the design and enforcement of property rights), are just a sampling of the concerns at the heart of the science of economics.A sample of 347 students, enrolled in principles of economics classes during the period 1997–2001, is used to examine the relation between class attendance and student performance on examinations. Among the questions examined are: Is attendance related to performance, with and without controls for other factors? Do only substantial levels of absence matter? Do low test scores cause more frequent subsequent absences? Do the results change when individual heterogeneity (in addition to controls for differences in SAT and GPA) is considered in the context of random‐effects and fixed‐effects models, using panel data? Can overall attendance be proxied by attendance at six meetings at the end of the semester, and does such a proxy yield the same relation to performance as overall attendance? We also study the factors that appear to contribute to improved classroom attendance.<br>
3.Productivity/Efficiency
Productivity, in economics, measures output per unit of input, such as labor, capital, or any other resource. It is often calculated for the economy as a ratio of gross domestic product (GDP) to hours worked.

Labor productivity may be further broken down by sector to examine trends in labor growth, wage levels, and technological improvement. Corporate profits and shareholder returns are directly linked to productivity growth.

At the corporate level, productivity is a measure of the efficiency of a company's production process, it is calculated by measuring the number of units produced relative to employee labor hours or by measuring a company's net sales relative to employee labor hours.Efficiency is the often measurable ability to avoid wasting materials, energy, efforts, money, and time in doing something or in producing a desired result. In a more general sense, it is the ability to do things well, successfully, and without waste.[1][2][3][4][5]

In more mathematical or scientific terms, it signifies the level of performance that uses the least amount of inputs to achieve the highest amount of output. It often specifically comprises the capability of a specific application of effort to produce a specific outcome with a minimum amount or quantity of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort.[6] Efficiency refers to very different inputs and outputs in different fields and industries. In 2019, the European Commission said: "Resource efficiency means using the Earth's limited resources in a sustainable manner while minimising impacts on the environment. It allows us to create more with less and to deliver greater value with less input."[7]

Writer Deborah Stone notes that efficiency is "not a goal in itself. It is not something we want for its own sake, but rather because it helps us attain more of the things we value
